# Welcome to my readme file.
## This is a sorting application

This application allows the user to upload data from local storage (txt) and use that information to sort it randomly between groups and topics.
-[Program](https://github.com/Jaydotcom27/tendencias-2/blob/master/Program.cs)

## Instructions

- This App runs on dotnet, make sure you have installed the latest version of C# dotnet.
- When the application runs using the command **dotnet run** it will demand 3 things. 
    1. The route for the txt file where the **students** list is written (one student per line, no empty spaces).
    2. The route for the txt file where the **topics** list is written (one topic per line, no empty spaces.)
    3. The **ammount** in numbers (int) of groups you want to sort the students in.
- After sending the 3 inputs the App is going to randomly sort the students for you in the ammount of groups specificated. Note: whenever the program
is unable to sort in equal groups, it is going to randomly send the remaining values into random existing groups.
